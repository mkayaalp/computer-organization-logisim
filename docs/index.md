This page demonstrates how [Logisim-evolution](https://github.com/logisim-evolution/logisim-evolution)
can be used to teach and learn computer organization topics.

The uses range from simple combinational and sequential circuits,
to sufficiently complex ones demonstrating the instruction execution,
memory, and input/output topics.

The circuit files can be found in the
[git repository](https://github.com/mkayaalp/computer-organization-logisim),
and this documentation can be found under the
[`docs`](https://github.com/mkayaalp/computer-organization-logisim/tree/master/docs) directory.
