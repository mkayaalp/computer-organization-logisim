title: Logic Design Review

A digital logic design course covers the topics of
[combinational](combinational.html) and
[sequential](sequential.html) digital circuits.
We can review the distinction of these circuit types
by showing simple Logisim examples.

For studying computer organization,
we are particularly interested in
[synchronous](synchronous.html) sequential circuits,
which make it easy for us to analyze the
[propagation delay](propagation-clock.html#propagation-delay)
and determine the
[clock period](propagation-clock.html#clock-period) requirements.
